# Overview of ASP.NET Core MVC

ASP.NET uses the MVC pattern. The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern separates an application into three main groups of components: Models, Views, and Controllers. This pattern helps to achieve separation of concerns. Using this pattern, user requests are routed to a Controller which is responsible for working with the Model to perform user actions and/or retrieve results of queries. The Controller chooses the View to display to the user, and provides it with any Model data it requires.

### **Model Responsibilities**
The Model in an MVC application represents the state of the application and any business logic or operations that should be performed by it. Business logic should be encapsulated in the model, along with any implementation logic for persisting the state of the application. Strongly-typed views typically use ViewModel types designed to contain the data to display on that view. The controller creates and populates these ViewModel instances from the model.

### **View Responsibilities**
Views are responsible for presenting content through the user interface. They use the Razor view engine to embed .NET code in HTML markup. There should be minimal logic within views, and any logic in them should relate to presenting content. If you find the need to perform a great deal of logic in view files in order to display data from a complex model, consider using a View Component, ViewModel, or view template to simplify the view.

### **Controller Responsibilities**
Controllers are the components that handle user interaction, work with the model, and ultimately select a view to render. In an MVC application, the view only displays information; the controller handles and responds to user input and interaction. In the MVC pattern, the controller is the initial entry point, and is responsible for selecting which model types to work with and which view to render (hence its name - it controls how the app responds to a given request).
